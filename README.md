# Cybersecurity_Side_Projects
This is a repository of self-guided projects I am working on to further investigate cybersecurity issues while taking Cybersecurity Fundamentals Microbachelors courses.
The objective of creating this repository is to integrate more projects-based learning into my understanding of cybersecurity and IT.
